The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of template-based
classes and functions in C++ that provides reusable, generic data structures
and algorithms. It is part of the
C++ Standard Library and is designed to promote
efficient, type-safe, and flexible programming.
The STL is widely used for its performance and versatility in
handling common programming tasks.
